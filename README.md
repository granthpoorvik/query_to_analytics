When we donâ€™t white list the libraries then we face this issue

to resolve this we need to add the library to the below line

df1_sdf = SmartDataframe(df1, config={"llm": model,"custom_whitelisted_dependencies": ["scikit-learn","sqlalchemy","typing","io","pandasai","os","chr","glob","collections","sys","pathlib","future"     <><><><><>APPEND HERE<><><><><>],"security":"none","enable_cache":False})
